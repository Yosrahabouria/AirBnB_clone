0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static üè°
irbnb is an online platform that connects people who have a home to offer, with people who need a place to stay temporarily.

The first stage of the project was where we started to create The AirBnB Clone and we created a shell to manage the AirBnB objects.

This first stage of the project focused on everything related to Python:

Import, Exceptions, Class, Private attribute, Getter / Setter, Class method, Static method, Inheritance, Unittest, Read / Write file, args and kwargs, Serialization / Deserialization and JSON.

Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it‚Äôs time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to ‚Äúdesign‚Äù / ‚Äúsketch‚Äù / ‚Äúprototype‚Äù each element:
